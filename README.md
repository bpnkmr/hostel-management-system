Cooperatively worked with a team of 3 to implement a Java & Database Management System (DBMS) for our college (PCET's NMIET) as a part of Third Year's project, which aims at tracking as well as reducing the manual work for managing the Hostel, Beds, Rooms, Allottees and Rent from the administrator's end.
